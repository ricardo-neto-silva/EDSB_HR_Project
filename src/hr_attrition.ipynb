    "\n",
    "- **OverTime** demonstrates by far the highest percentage variation (128.6%), more than three times greater than any other variable. This suggests that overtime work is the single most critical factor associated with employee attrition and warrants immediate attention in retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stock Options** show a substantial 37.6% variation, with employees possessing stock options exhibiting significantly lower attrition rates. This suggests that equity compensation may serve as an effective retention strategy, by strengthening organizational commitment and long-term alignment with the company's success.\n",

    "- **Tenure-related variables** (Years in Current Role: 35.3%, Years with Current Manager: 34.7%, Years at Company: 30.4%, Total Working Years: 30.5%) consistently rank among the top differentiators. Employees with higher tenure across these dimensions show lower attrition rates, indicating that role stability, manager continuity, and organizational tenure contribute positively to retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The newly created **Income_Rate_Ratio** (30.7%) exhibits greater percentage variation than either MonthlyIncome (29.9%) or MonthlyRate alone. This suggests that the relationship between these compensation metrics may reveal misalignment between employee remuneration and their perceived organizational value, potentially contributing to attrition decisions.\n",
