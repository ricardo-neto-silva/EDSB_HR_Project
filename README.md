The content of this repository corresponds to a project developed by Group 26 in the Enterprise Data Science Bootcamp course, as part of the Enterprise Data Science and Analytics Postgraduate Program at Nova IMS in 2025.

This project aims to understand the factors influencing employee turnover in an organization, through a detailed exploratory analysis and the identification of key variables that contribute most to this effect. Based on this, a machine learning predictive model was developed to anticipate the probability of each employee leaving. The generated insights serve as a basis for strategic recommendations and targeted actions, with the goal of increasing talent retention and strengthening the company’s competitiveness.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning to predict employee attrition. By analyzing demographic, job-related, and behavioral data, the model identifies employees at risk of leaving the organization.

The goal is to provide Human Resources with actionable insights to improve retention strategies. The project compares a baseline **XGBoost** model against a tuned **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**. The SVC was ultimately selected for its robust performance and stability during Cross-Validation.

### Part 2: Methodology & Metrics

## ⚙️ The Methodology

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering
To maximize predictive power, I engineered several custom features based on domain knowledge:
* **TenureIndex:** A composite score weighting years at the company vs. years in the current role.
* **PromotionGap:** Measures the stagnation period since the last promotion.
* **Income_Rate_Ratio:** Ratio of monthly income to daily rate to detect compensation disparities.
* **EngagementIndex:** Aggregation of Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, and Job Involvement.

### 2. The Pipeline
The project implements a robust `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` designed to prevent data leakage.

![Pipeline Visualization](pipeline_viz.png)

1.  **Custom Preprocessing (`PreprocessToDF`):** Calculates engineered features using training-set statistics (saved in `config.json`) to ensure new data is treated consistently.
2.  **Encoding (`ColumnTransformer`):**
    * `OrdinalEncoder` for ranked variables (e.g., *BusinessTravel*, *Education*).
    * `OneHotEncoder` for nominal variables (e.g., *Department*, *JobRole*).
3.  **Feature Selection:** A strict subset of predictive features was selected using multi-method analysis.
4.  **Scaling:** `StandardScaler` normalizes inputs (crucial for the SVC model).
5.  **Inference:** Probability estimation for attrition risk.

## 📊 Model Performance & Selection

I evaluated two primary candidates: a baseline XGBoost model and a tuned Support Vector Classifier (SVC).

### 🥇 Final Model: SVC (Tuned + Threshold Optimized)
* **Algorithm:** Support Vector Classifier (RBF Kernel)
* **Feature Set:** Strict (Selected Features)
* **Hyperparameters:** `C=8.53`, `gamma=0.0117`
* **Threshold:** **0.33** (Tuned)

| Metric | Cross-Validation Score | Test Set Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | **87.4%** | **85.4%** |
| **Precision** | **64.4%** | **55.0%** |
| **Recall** | **54.2%** | 46.8% |
| **F1-Score** | **58.0%** | **50.6%** |

### 🥈 Baseline Model: XGBoost
* **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosted Trees
* **Feature Set:** Moderate
* **Threshold:** Default (0.50)

| Metric | Cross-Validation Score | Test Set Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 85.6% | 84.0% |
| **Precision** | 56.6% | 50.0% |
| **Recall** | 48.9% | **48.9%** |
| **F1-Score** | 52.4% | 49.5% |

> **Conclusion:** The **SVC model was selected** because it outperformed the baseline XGBoost across **all Cross-Validation metrics**, demonstrating better generalization. On the Test Set, it achieved higher Accuracy (+1.4%) and F1-Score (+1.1%), validating the decision to use a stricter feature set and tuned threshold.
